  <p>
    Mazda has always stood out in the automotive industry for its blend of
    aesthetic appeal, reliability, and performance. Renowned for their KODO:
    “Soul of Motion” design philosophy, Mazda vehicles aren’t just about
    getting from point A to B; they’re crafted to elevate the driving
    experience.

    The brand’s commitment to environmental sustainability, through its
    SKYACTIV technology, provides drivers with fuel-efficient yet powerful
    vehicles. This unique combination of design, performance, and
    environmental consciousness has garnered Mazda a loyal following and
    numerous industry accolades.<sup>1</sup>

    The 2024 lineup is a testament to Mazda’s continued innovation. Each
    model, from the sleek Mazda3 to the versatile CX-5, has been enhanced with
    new features that blend style, comfort, and technology. A new three-row
    crossover is being added to the product line, called the CX-90, which is
    an exciting new option that is replacing the CX-9. There are also rumours
    that the Mazda MX-5 Miata is getting a complete redesign, but this has not
    yet been confirmed.<sup>2</sup>

    The buzz is particularly strong around their new electric vehicle
    offerings, designed to bring Mazda’s renowned driving experience into the
    era of sustainable mobility. While specifics are not fully known yet,
    hints of advanced driver assistance systems, improved connectivity
